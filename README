Toy city simulator for practicing classes, modules, PEP 8 and version control

MODULES:

    service_classes.py - this is where I began, just revising classes, with some basic city services like police and fire.

    suburbs.py - contains methods and data for suburbs class.

    grid_maker.py - makes a 10x10 numpy meshgrid and performs plotting of suburbs.

    city.py - the mostly text driven script to put it all together.



TODO:
    ~~When suburb size reaches a set level, a new suburb will automatically be generated nearby~~
    The coverage of services and the level of wealth determines happiness levels
